# AxeFx_tools
this repo is in active development. Will be constantly updated by any new tools





### Material Processor
a WIP Houdini tool that can ingest most materials -Principled, Arnold and MTLX for now- then convert them to any chosen render engine.
The tool has it's logging mechanism that's seperate from Houdini. The code adheres to pip-standard clean code as much as possible.
I do have big plans to extend it's functionality to .usd files and other apps like Substance Painter, Maya and blender.

#### Roadmap
- [ ] Add Changelog
- [ ] Fix Ingestion for Arnold and MTLX
- [ ] Add usd conversions
